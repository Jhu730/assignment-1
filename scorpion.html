        The deathstalker scorpion is a venomous species of scorpion that is
        native to the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. It is one of
        the most venomous scorpions in the world and its sting can cause a range
        of symptoms including intense pain, muscle twitching, nausea, and in
        severe cases, death. The deathstalker is a yellow-brown color, with a
        heavy exoskeleton and a distinctive pair of pincers used for capturing
        its prey.
