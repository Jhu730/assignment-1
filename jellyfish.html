    <p>
        The box jellyfish is a highly venomous species of jellyfish that inhabits the waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is named for its cube-like shape, with tentacles that trail from each of its corners. The box jellyfish is one of the most dangerous creatures in the ocean, with its sting causing intense pain, heart failure, and death in severe cases.
